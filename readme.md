Create an application that can manage a library. Users should be able to log into this app, search for books, borrow books and return books.
Some users are administrators. The admin should be able to restock books, track borrowed and available books, including return time and due dates. Each borrowed book is due to be returned after 2 weeks.

1. User should receive welcome email after registration
2. User should be logged in to his account with a welcome message after successful registration
3. The user homepage should show list of available books
4. The user can only borrow one book at a time.
5. Each borrowed book is due for return after 2 weeks maximum
6. Admin can mark a book as returned, or send reminder to the user
7. Admin can extend the borrowed book time by 1 week (this can only be done once)
8. User will receive email alert daily once the return time remains 1 week

We'll use Express.js for the server framework, MongoDB for the database, and JWT for authentication.Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to building a basic library website with user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Node.js, Express.js for the backend, and React.js for the frontend:

### Backend (Node.js with Express.js):

#### Step 1: Setup

1. Install Node.js if you haven't already.
2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
3. Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init -y`.
4. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install express mongoose jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
   ```

#### Step 2: Set up Express Server

1. Create an `index.js` file for your server.
2. Set up Express server and basic routes.
3. Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.

#### Step 3: Authentication

1. Set up user model with MongoDB schema using Mongoose.
2. Implement user registration endpoint (`/api/auth/register`) to create new users.
3. Implement user login endpoint (`/api/auth/login`) to authenticate users and generate JWT tokens.
4. Implement authentication middleware to protect routes that require authentication.
5. Optionally, implement a route to verify JWT tokens.

### Frontend (React.js):

#### Step 4: Setup

1. Initialize a new React.js project using Create React App:
   ```
   npx create-react-app library-frontend
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd library-frontend`.

#### Step 5: UI Components

1. Create necessary UI components like login form, registration form, book listing, etc.
2. Set up React Router for navigation between different pages.

#### Step 6: API Integration

1. Use Axios or Fetch API to make HTTP requests to backend API endpoints.
2. Implement functionality to register users and login/logout.

#### Step 7: Authentication

1. Store JWT tokens securely in local storage or cookies upon successful login.
2. Implement logic to check for the presence of a valid token on protected routes.
3. Handle authentication errors and redirect users accordingly.

### Additional Considerations:

1. **Validation**: Implement validation for user inputs on both frontend and backend to ensure data integrity.
2. **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully on both frontend and backend, providing informative error messages to users.
3. **Security**: Implement security best practices such as input sanitization, authentication, authorization, and HTTPS.
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the website is mobile-friendly and responsive across different screen sizes.
5. **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests for both frontend and backend code to ensure reliability and maintainability.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the application on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean, considering scalability and performance.

Following these steps should help you build a basic library website with user authentication using JWT, Node.js, Express.js, and React.js. Feel free to ask if you need further clarification on any step!
